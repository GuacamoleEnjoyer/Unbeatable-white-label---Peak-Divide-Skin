# Unbeatable-white-label---Peak-Divide-Skin
Custom skin for Unbeatable

To install, simply find the folder labeled "UNBEATABLE [white label]_Data."

Inside this folder, there will be a file called "sharedassets3.assets." I would urge you to make a copy of the original.
Replace the original sharedassets3.assets with the one you've downloaded here. When you load up your game, Beat will now be wearing the Peak Divide skin during songs.

A more streamlined method to swap skins is currently being developed. This initial skin for Beat is partially a test. 
When that time comes, this document and the YouTube video will be uploaded accordingly.

Enjoy the skin! Enjoy the game! Enjoy anime!
